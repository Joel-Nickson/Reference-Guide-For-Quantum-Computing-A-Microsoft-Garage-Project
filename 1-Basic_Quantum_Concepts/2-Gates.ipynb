    "\n",
    "Since qubit states are represented with vectors, the way to manipulate them is through matrix\n",
    "multiplications, which transforms a vector into a different vector. Such matrix operations applied onto the states are called \"gates\". In quantum mechanics, matrices representing gates are required to be unitary (see _Math insert - unitary, adjoint or Hermitian conjugate_ ). This is to ensure normalization condition, i.e. probabilities add up to 1, mentioned in Section 1.1. Unitarity also constraints the operation to be reversible. This is intuitive as one can find an operation that reverts the gate and returns a system back to its original state.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the end of session 1.1, we introduced a generalized probability theory. The key is that probability is\n",
    "equal to the _square of magnitude of amplitude_ , so the square of amplitude must be a positive number\n",
    "between 0 and 1. Here, we're going to look at the idea of interference between different possibilities,\n",
    "which is something that is typical of quantum mechanics, but not of classical probability theory.\n",
    "Interference occurs because we use amplitudes, rather than probabilities, and amplitudes can be negative\n",
    "or complex. Let's use a metaphorical example to illustrate this abstract idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say Bob is someone who may like sports and/or computer games. He has a 70% chance of liking\n",
    "sports (푆푆) and a 30% chance of not liking sports (푆푆̅). If he likes sports, there is an 80% chance that he likes\n",
    "computer games (퐶퐶) and a 20% chance that he does not like computer games (퐶퐶̅). If he does not like sports,\n",
    "there is a 10% chance he likes computer games, and a 90% chance that he doesn't. This situation is\n",
    "depicted as a tree on the left of Figure 1.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the chance that Bob likes computer games? We can compute this by aid of the probability\n",
    "tree. There are two paths we can go down the tree to end up at 퐶퐶: 푆푆→퐶퐶 and 푆푆̅→퐶퐶. We can multiply the\n",
    "branching probabilities down each path, and then add the paths together. In this case, the probability of\n",
    "퐶퐶 is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "푃푃(퐶퐶)= 0.7 × 0.8 + 0.3 × 0.1 = 0. 59 , or 59%.\n",
    "```\n",
    "But what if Bob were a quantum system? In that case, we would work with amplitudes. The tree\n",
    "on the right of Figure 1.9 shows one possible set of amplitudes, which give the same branching possibilities.\n",
    "Instead of calculating the probability of Bob liking computer games, we'll first calculate the amplitude. If\n",
    "we switch the word \"probability\" to \"amplitude\" in the above calculation, then everything is the same.\n",
    "Because in a quantum system, the amplitude could be a positive, negative or a complex number, let's\n",
    "assign a negative amplitude to one of the branches in Figure 1.9 to prove our point next. We find all the\n",
    "paths to get to 퐶퐶, and multiply the amplitudes along the path, and then sum the amplitudes of the paths:\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "푃푃(퐶퐶)=|푎푎푐푐|^2 ≈0.548, or 54.8%.\n",
    "```\n",
    "The second path actually subtracts from the first path, causing the overall probability to decrease. Very\n",
    "strangely, the fact that there's a second way for Bob to like computer games _decreases_ the probability\n",
    "that he likes them! This is because the amplitude of the second path has the opposite sign from the\n",
    "amplitude for the first path. We call this \"destructive interference.\" If the amplitudes had the same sign,\n",
    "the second path would reinforce the first, and we would get \"constructive interference.\" Interference is\n",
    "fundamentally caused by the fact that amplitudes can be negative, or even complex, allowing them to\n",
    "cancel one another out. Interference is at the heart of much of the \"strangeness\" of quantum mechanics.\n",
