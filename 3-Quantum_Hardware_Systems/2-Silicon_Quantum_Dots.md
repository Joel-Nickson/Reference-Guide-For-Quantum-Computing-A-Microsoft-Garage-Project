## 3.2 Silicon quantum dots

A quantum dot is a way to trap a single electron in a controllable manner. It is achieved by confining
electrons in the 0th dimension (0D). The following shows possible dimensionalities electrons can occupy.
A 0D scenario is not easily found in natural materials but we can create an artificial trap in a semiconductor.

These graphics are a simplification that describes dimensionalities for electrons to occupy. In an actual
material, there are also nuclei inside atoms and defects in the crystal lattices, but we are only drawing
the presence of electrons.
```
To make a quantum dot, we can start from 2D. Electrons can be confined into a plane at the
interface between two semiconducting materials grown in laboratories and fabrication facilities, because
they are not natural. Such an electron plane is called a 2D electron gas (2DEG).

```
AlGaAs and GaAs are examples of two commonly used semiconductors for making a 2DEG. The search
for the best materials for quantum dot quantum computing is an ongoing effort.
```

Next, we can deposit some metal structures above the 2DEG. By applying appropriate voltages to
the metals, electrons underneath can be removed. This process is called "depletion". We can create all
kinds of shapes for the metals, forming little islands in the 2DEG where electrons can be depleted one by
one until only one electron is left in an island.

This is our electron trap. The electron acts as a qubit whose spin defines its state. It can be
manipulated with magnetic or electric fields applied from the electrodes. To have multiple qubits, several
traps can be created next to one another. The magnetic dipole interaction between nearby electrons
allows them to couple and entangle.

Quantum dots are one of the "artificial atoms" we can engineer. A natural atom has a
nucleus bounding electrons to their orbits. Mimicking the bounding of electrons,
quantum dots behave like atoms.
Some of the methods of producing qubits in the following sessions, such as
making crystal defects and superconducting circuits, can also be considered as creating
"artificial atoms". A defect in a crystal lattice can act like a nucleus trapping an electron

introduced by a foreign atom. A superconducting circuit has energy levels reminiscent
of the energy levels of electrons inside an atom, even though the circuit does not have
direct analogies of electrons and nucleus.
In fact, we can find many systems in the universe behaving in similar ways, by
looking at their mathematical descriptions. For example, comparing the energy
equations of an oscillating circuit and a pendulum and the Schrödinger equation of a
hydrogen atom, the equations have the same form and we can see parameters that
appear at the same locations of these equations. They are counterparts in
electromagnetism, mechanics and quantum mechanics. Thus, by grasping the
similarities, we can make an electromagnetic pendulum or a qubit in a solid-state
circuit, which do not directly occur in nature. See the sections on crystal defects and
superconducting circuits for details.
Below summarizes the very similar Hamiltonians, H, of several seemingly
different systems. Compare the mass on a spring with the classical LC circuit or the
pendulum with the superconducting circuit.

To elaborate more on the beauty of finding patterns in the universe, the
Maxwell's equations, for example, allow us to see that light behaves as an
electromagnetic wave with a constant speed of propagation, 푓푓= �휖휖 0 휇휇 0. We are using

electromagnetic waves or light throughout Phase 3 as the method to control and
manipulate qubits.

```
The symmetry in the Maxwell's equations is also how Einstein was able to formulate
the special theory of relativity in 1905 and discover the famous energy and mass
relation 퐸퐸 = 퐼퐼푓푓^2.
