## 3.3 Crystal defects

We can also trap electrons in crystal lattices, such as diamond or silicon. Imagine a carbon atom (which
has six electrons) inside diamond is replaced by a nitrogen atom (which has seven electrons). The nitrogen
atom introduces a vacancy and an extra electron to the lattice. This electron is bound to the nitrogen-
vacancy region (called the "NV center"). Its spin can be manipulated with a focused laser light â€“ an
electromagnetic field. Qubits made from crystal defects can be isolated from noise. But practically it is
hard to scale due to difficulty in growing crystal defects in the lab.
